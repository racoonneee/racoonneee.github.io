                <p>The fall was attributable to a series of hawkish remarks Yoon made on North Korea as well as a row with Na Kyung-won, a former four-term PPP lawmaker considered a leading potential contender for PPP leader, according to Bae Cheol-ho, a senior analyst at Realmeter. Na offered to resign as vice chair of the presidential committee on low birthrates after her policy suggestion ran afoul of the presidential office, and Yoon later fired her not only from the position, but also as ambassador for climate and environment. Yoon's move was widely seen as an expression of displeasure with Na potentially running for PPP leader.</p>

                <p>The number of self-employed people had been on the skids since peaking at 6.21 million in 2002.  Self-employed businesses with employees numbered 4.27 million last year, the highest in 14 years, with the number of those without employees rising to 1.36 million last year from 1.31 million in 2021.   South Korea's self-employed people have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent social distancing measures, which have sent the country's consumer spending slumping. In contrast, the proportion of wage earners in the country hit an all-time high of 76.5 percent last year, up from 76.1 percent in 2022 and 45 percentage points higher than in 1963.</p>

                <p>Kwon captured the men's singles title at the Adelaide International 2 on Saturday in Adelaide, Australia. He became the first South Korean player with multiple AT Tour titles. Kwon had also climbed to No. 52 in November 2021, two months after his maiden ATP title at the Astana Open. Kwon is scheduled to play his first-round match of the Australian Open, the season's first Grand Slam tournament, Monday afternoon in Melbourne. His opponent will be Christopher Eubanks of the United States, world No. 116. Kwon beat Eubanks in their only previous meeting last year. (Yonhap) </p>
